# Mamba Capsule Routing Towards Part-Whole Relational Camouflaged Object Detection


![MCG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d75661d0-efdf-4a99-801a-e40b8f2e7559)
We introduce the Mamba to generate type-level mamba capsules from the pixel-level capsules for routing, which ensures a lightweight computation, further exploring the part-whole hierarchical relationships in COD.
