# ðŸ’Š Mamba Capsule Routing Towards Part-Whole Relational Camouflaged Object Detection (MCRNet)


![MCRNet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/400b892b-633e-4e41-bf39-25686d4b1179)

We introduce the Mamba to generate type-level mamba capsules from the pixel-level capsules for routing, which ensures a lightweight computation, further exploring the part-whole hierarchical relationships in COD.
